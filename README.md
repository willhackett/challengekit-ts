# ChallengeKit TS

This is the challenge starter kit for TypeScript with the compiler setup for the Node.js runtime. It provides a recommended `eslint` config — `eslint-config-google` which uses Google's style guide.

This project has been prepared using yarn. It is recommended, but not necessary if you wish to continue using `npm`.

To use yarn, install it with `npm i -g yarn`.

## Scripts

```
  $ yarn build — TypeScript Compile to dist folder
  $ yarn start — Run compiled code in dist folder
  $ yarn test — Run the Jest test suite, defaults to all *.test.ts files
  $ yarn watch — Run te Jest test suite in watch mode
```

## VSCode Workspace

1. Format on save is enabled
2. Prettier is set as the default auto-formatter
